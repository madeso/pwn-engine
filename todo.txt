* investigate other, more liberal, licenses
* support more os's like linux & mac
* add more unit tests
* update/rewrite rendering so that it doesnt need special features like shaders, but uses them if available?
* refactor pwn.render to look like target api
* include wxWidgets for messageboxes, exception displays and crash reporting
* convert or remove pwn.math in favor of the tested cml
* test astyle on pwn source
--------------------------
------------- features:
* tranform into vbos & vertex shaders (indexed vbo!)
 - an8 file loading
 - transform to cpu updated vbos
 - add material shaders
 - support loading vertex & fragment from different files & preprocessor
 - per pixel lights
 - improve material system to send several textures to shaders
 - transform to gpu updated vbos
* convert to lowercase-only filenames
* improve math and rgb(a) library, memberfunctions, more syntactic sugar - still relevant?
* improve display framework to support huds
 - font support
* console w/ lua/gamemonkey scripts
* 3d debugging (wireframe, view skeleton, draw boundingbox, draw position, line etc)
* add multiple textures and multiple instances to materials so that overiding & animating materials can be more easily supported
* material effects, bump/normal map, animated textures, water
* start on component framework
* sound engine
* level editor
* scripting support for leveleditor, visual? point and click? gamemaker? labview? Google app inventor (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_App_Inventor)?, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language
* add physics to component framework
* gui editor for components
* character engine
 - character mechanics, modern approach to character animation, character scripting, animation state machines, animation blending
* find out if fse is needed, or if a scripting approach should be used instead
 - rewrite render.fse so that it doesn't use io code
 - scripting, settings & gui editor for fse
 - improve fse to support different "logical" paths
* particle engine, check old notes
* ssao
* area support, camera effects(fse, shake...), scrips(enter, leave, onTick)
* shadows
* improve rendering speed with portals
* ai base
* pathfinding
