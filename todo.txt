math: add functioncalltype specifications for easy use with libraries
math: remove quatw and quat(x,y,z,w) contructor in favor of the vec-real constructors
general: investigate other, more liberal, licenses
test: add more tests
math: make easier to use, more member functions, use external? cml?
support more os's like linux & mac
rewrite rendering so that it doesn't use io code
rewrite rendering so that it doesnt need special features like shaders, but uses them if available?
--------------------------
------------- features:
* dynamic lights
* tranform into vbos & vertex shaders
 - add material shaders
 - per pixel lights
 - support loading vertex & fragment from different files
 - make boneassignemnts to a seperate vec4 array in preperations for gpu animation & multiple bone assignments
 - transform to cpu updated vbos
 - transform to gpu updated vbos
* investigate bug in physfs, mixing objCount & size?, move back to stable?
* font support ( to be merged with "improve display framework"? )
* console
* scripting support
* scripting, settings & gui editor for fse
* 3d debugging (wireframe, view skeleton, draw boundingbox, draw position, line etc)
* particle engine
* start on component framework
* sound engine
* character engine
* gui editor for components
* level editor
* add physics to component framework
* improve fse to support different "logical" paths
* improve display framework to support huds
* ssao
* material effects, bump/normal map, animated textures, water
* shadows
* improve rendering speed with portals
* ai base
* pathfinding
